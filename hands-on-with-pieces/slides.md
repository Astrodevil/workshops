# Classroom and Lecture Assistance

With Pieces, you can:

<v-clicks>

- Enhance Classroom Learning
- Use Pieces Copilot Chats to get instant explanations for concepts discussed in lectures.
- Generate examples and practice problems on the fly.
- Summarize lecture notes for quick review.


</v-clicks>

<!--
By using AI, you can 10x your productivity.

You start with an LLM, leveraging the knowledge they have from being trained on public code bases.

You can then augment them by using them in a copilot where they are integrated into your IDE, gathering context from your workflow.

Next you can add code snippets as context for your copilot. Over time developers build up a library of useful code snippets, and you can use these in your Copilot.

Finally, you can add more context from other activities to your Copilot. For example, you can add context from documentation, collaboration tools, and more.

And ideally, a lot of this should be as automatic as possible, requiring minimal input from you.

Over the rest of this session, we will explore these concepts in more detail, and demo how you can use these tools to 10x your productivity.

I'll be demoing using Pieces for Developers as my copilot

<!--

Demo using the Pieces copilot in VS Code.

Show the extension in the marketplace.
Show the copilot extension in the IDE


Start a new conversation - each conversation has it's own context, so adding to an existing conversation will use the answers from before,
a new conversation will not.


Use Pieces explain to ask the copilot to explain some other code.

# Add more context to your Copilot

<!--
To make the responses from the Copilot more relevant, you need to add more context to it.

For example, you might want the copilot to understand an entire project by adding the project folder to the context of the conversation.
You might also want to add snippets, or individual files.

-->

layout: center

# Demo

Collect snippets from where you are / active file

<!--
Snippets should be easy to grab so they become part of your workflow. This means snippet collection should be where you are, 
such as in your IDE or browser.


From the IDE grab a snippet of the copilot_service
From the browser grab a snippet from https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Image-class.html - the same image snippet

In this demo, we will demonstrate how to efficiently collect code snippets from your active file, whether you are working in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a web browser. You can use chrome extension, Vs Code extension or others but all snippets will be stored in one place.  

-->

# Demo

Use local files/folders in your Copilot

<!--

- Create a new conversation and add the my amazing flutter app folder or file as context. Then ask questions:
    - Describe this app
    - what dependencies does this app have

# Interruptions can be costly

<!--

Interruptions can be costly - it can take 15-30 minutes to get back to the same level of focus after an interruption

Show Live context demo or Just remind of earlier demo.

Open https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71939373/how-to-use-overlay-spinner-in-flutter in the browser. Read the docs for a bit, then follow the link to spinkit on pub.dev

Create a new conversation and ask what was I doing just now in my browser
